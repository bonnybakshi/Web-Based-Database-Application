## Description 
The goal of this project was to create a web-based database application for a salon owner that will allows him/her to track client details, appointments, scheduling, as well as menu and rate card of various services offered. This application will be a key tool in tracking appointments for each client individually and will replace the manual process of scheduling in single-table spreadsheet. Using this application, clients will be able to book appointments themselves via a web-based interface. However, my project as of now just focuses on admin privileges only.  I shall be developing client privileges in due time.
